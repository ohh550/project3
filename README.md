# Project 3 Handmade Website

For Project #3, it was a project related to code class titled Handmade Website was to create a website 
using HTML, CSS. Purpose to create a network of pages as a non-linear poem. Each word or phrase is linked 
to another page that expands upon this poem or story. This poem can be purely text-based or include images. 
In my case I chose to create an informational website on the topic of my choice.

## Design Process

For the design process of this project I was thinking of ideas of what to show by having networks of pages
and I wanted to share this idea of mine that I was always having and wandering. Which is the question of
why is psychic photos dissapearing? When we were young and when technologies were new such as cameras! We
heard rumors and pictures shown to us about how ghosts were captured and ufos are seen inside pictures and
being scared was talked before. However as time kept passing the more news about that has been shrinking
and I did researches and all and it was found out that it due to the camera quality that has been improving
now. Now adays taking pictures by zooming in comes with such a high resolution pictures but before all the
psychic pictures or ufo pictures we saw were just reflections of something such as plastic bags and I for my
designs I just gatheres all the photos that I was able to find by remembering past psychic photos I have seen
when I was young.

## Refelction

This project was a very fun project where I was able to learn basics of html and javascript and create my
own site and explain the topic that I wanted to everyone. I would say if I learned more interactive things in
html or javascript I would definitely add more interactions into site and add moving pictures or gifs and 
short videos into my site.
